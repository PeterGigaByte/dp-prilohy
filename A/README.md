# 3D GUI visualiser for NS-3
3D GUI visualiser for NS-3 created for Diploma thesis by Bc. Peter Rigo.
Gui is free to use for researches. 
It is created in Python language. Developed with PyQt5 and VTK libraries. 
This research was leaded by Ing. Stanislav Marƒçek, PhD.

Goal of this project is to find optimisations for NS-3
visualiser and create 3D GUI to visualise simulation generated by NS-3.

To generate NS-3 tracing file was used NetAnim with some adjustment to include
"z" coordinate because normal version does not support this. 

Application consist of these main parts:

View:
* Environment
  * View to visualise NS-3 animations
* Manage
  * View to test new objects included in animation
* Settings
  * View to manage settings

Parsers:
* XML
  * TreeElement parser
  * Dom parser
* JSON
  * JSON parser

H2 database

XML to JSON convertor

Data processor:
* Responsible for provide correct data in steps for animation

Network elements objects:
There are defined all objects with tags that can be possibly parsed.
